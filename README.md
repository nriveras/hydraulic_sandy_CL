O'Higgins Region in central Chile accounts for 40% of the country's maize production, which is mostly cultivated in monocultures. Subsequently, intensive tillage practices have generated physical degradation with important effects on soil water movements, which can change considerably even in a small area. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the spatial variability of different physical and hydraulic soil properties of an Inceptisol under agricultural use, due to the level of compaction and its relationship with soil hydrophobicity. The experiment was carried out in a farm of Central Chile, in a continuous fallow-maize system under conventional tillage. In a systematic sampling, penetration resistance (PR) was measured, defining two areas, high and low PR. In each area soil samples were taken in-the-wheel-track (WT) and outside-the-wheel-track (OWT) as well as on the Topsoil and Subsoil, establishing four treatments: OWT-Topsoil (T1); OWT-Subsoil (T2); WT-Topsoil (T3); WT-Subsoil (T4). Within these treatments, soil organic matter (OM), texture, bulk density (BD), hydraulic conductivity (K) and hydrophobicity (R) were measured. The soil was an Inceptisol with sandy loam textural class (7.4% clay). PR ranged from 0.2 to 2 MPa at the surface and 0.6 to 2.4 MPa at 30 cm depth (plow-pan), and the OM content was higher with low PR, but not significant (α > 0.05) between positions (OWT/WT) and depths (Topsoil/Subsoil), as well as the BD and the repellency index (R). K varied between 0.6 and 18 cm h-1, being greater in depth as tillage disrupted macropores generated at the surface during the growing season. There was no difference between K at different positions. A linear relationship was found between K and R, explaining the differences between high and low PR sites.
